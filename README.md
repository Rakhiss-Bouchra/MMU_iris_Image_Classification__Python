##### Context
Multimedia University (MMU1) database is a public database consisting of Eye Images for training models of IRIS based Biometric attendance system. IRIS patterns for each Eye are unique for every individual and this is helpful in identifying an individual. This Dataset consist of both 5 images each of left and right IRIS of 46 persons, totalling 460 images along with few empty files. IRIS segmentation can be performed for Individual identification/classifying an IRIS image according to saved data base.

### Libraries
- TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an open-source software library for machine learning and deep learning. It is used for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. 
- Keras (from tensorflow): Keras is a high-level neural network API that is built on top of TensorFlow. It provides a simplified interface for creating and training neural networks.
- Numpy: Numpy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 
- PIL (Pillow) Image: The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter. It supports opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
- Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides functions for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- Numpy (asarray): Numpy's asarray function creates an array from any input data, and this specific import is likely to be used to convert a list or other data structure into a Numpy array.
- OS: The OS module in Python provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system. In this code, the "listdir" function from the OS module is imported, which returns a list of all files and directories in the given directory.
